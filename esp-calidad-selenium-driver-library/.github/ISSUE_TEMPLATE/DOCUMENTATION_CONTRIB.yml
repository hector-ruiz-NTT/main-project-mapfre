        First, thanks for taking time to contribute to this project. We have tried to
        make a stable project, correct errors and add new features continuously. You can
        help us do more.
        Before you invest time in writing documentation, please create an issue to discuss
        it and ensure that your time is well spent. This will help us to understand your
        ideas and provide early feedback.

        Once the contribution is ready and you have created the pull request, we will
        prioritize its review. Depending on how busy we are at the moment, this review
        may take time to being, and time to progress. GitHub will notify you as new
        comments are added to the pull request conversation, so you can stay up-to-date
        with any progress along the review.
        Please do not make assumptions about the speed at which this will happen, and
        please acknowledge that we may need time to work on it. Thanks for understanding.
        When the review is in motion, please attend to any comment or request for change
        that we have asked for. Let's keep the discussion in a kind and civic manner,
        specially when you do not agree.
        Remember that you can edit the contribution files directly from the browser,
        standing on the page of the pull request, look for "Files changed", and clicking
        on the button "Change this file using the online editor" and represented with the
        pencil icon.
        Solve the problems or concerns of a pull request may not be the final step. The
        review process can be repeated in several iterations. Please attend the
        successive comments and requests, until the contribution is either accepted, or
        discarded for various reasons.
